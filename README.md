# my-sqlite


These projects were completed in order to understand SQL and databases, specifically related to building web apps using Ruby on Rails.

The repo includes MyRedisClass which will act like a Key-Value database, MySqliteRequest and MySelectQuery which mimic making database requests using SQL, as well as a command line SQLITE interface.
