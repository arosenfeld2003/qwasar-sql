# my-sqlite


These projects were completed in order to understand SQL and databases, specifically related to building web apps using Ruby on Rails.

MyRedisClass acts like a Key-Value database, and creates or loads from a data-storage dump file. MySqliteRequest and MySelectQuery mimic making database requests using SQL.  My_sqlite_cli is an interface allowing the user to call these methods from the command line.
